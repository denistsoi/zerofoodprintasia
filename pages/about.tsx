                    To even things out, ZFPA members collect a few dollars per
                    meal which adds up to make renewable farming possible. Think
                    of it as crowd-funded grants to farmers for the
                    carbon-storing benefits of growing better food.

                  acres of healthy soil and removing tonnes of carbon from the
                  atmosphere. The Carbon Neutrality / LCA Program additonally
                  equips food businesses with the tools to become increasingly
