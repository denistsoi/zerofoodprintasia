              in California, is a nonprofit organization mobilizing the food
              world around agricultural climate solutions. ZFPA hosts a
              crowdfunding program that gathers funds from member food
              businesses such as restaurants, cafes, bars and food retailers.
              Every member pledges 1% of their revenue to ZFPA to fund
              regenerative farming practices that draw down carbon from the
              atmosphere and help combat global warming; this is the ZFP model.

              Our aim is to engage the hospitality sector in climate solutions
              and create a culture where it is normal for food businesses and
              customers to directly bring about improvements in the food system.
              Food businesses participate by becoming a ZFPA member and
              customers contribute by spending at member food businesses. With
              just a few dollars per customer, we help restore the climate one
              meal at a time.
